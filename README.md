# Module 1 Challenge

## Description
As a developer, I wanted to refract the codebase to follow accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. This was achieved by adding a proper title to the site so when the page is searched for, it will give information as to what the page is about. Alt tags were also added to images, these will appear if the image is unable to load properly and will help visually impaired users recognize what is being displayed when using a screen reader. The CSS file selectors and properties were consolidated and the overall flow was reorganized to follow a more smooth semantic structure. The HTML was also updated to reflect the changes made to the stylesheet. Comments were also added for both the CSS and HTML to make it easier for other developers to read the code. 
Throughout this refracting project, I learned how to link to another part of the same page and how to take a screenshot of an entire webpage using dev tools. I experimented with different CSS values to see how the page reacted to the changes, which helped me better understand their functions.

## Usage
When you visit the page at https://milena-allaway.github.io/module_1_challenge/ you will see a page that looks like this:
```md
<img src="/assets/images/module_1_challenge_githubpage_screenshot.png">
```
You can click on the links in the navigation bar, in the header, to take you to specific content. Or you can simply scroll down the page.

## Credits
A lot of the code selectors, tags, properties, and values were looked up on https://www.W3schools.com
My BCS tutor, Alistair Rowden, was helpful in helping me better understand CSS positioning and different properties when working with a box-model and provided some clarity on 'float','clear:both',and 'display: inline-block' properties in CSS.
The instructor at BCS, Edward Apostol, and the T.A, Veronica Tia Chi To, were always quick to answer my questions related to Git and provided many online resources along the way, such as best comment practises and how to write a README:

An AskBCS Learning Assistant named Royce provided the following links to help me attatch a screenshot to this README :

For everything else Git related inculding repositories and deployment, Github Docs was used:

"Tony Teaches Tech" youtube video helped me figure out how things are linked on different parts of the same page:
